    "(formal definition)\n",
    "a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective.\n",
    "It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent has 2 parts:\n",
    "- the brain (AI model) <-- AI model handles reasoning and planning\n",
    "    - it decides which Actions to take based on the situation\n",
    "    - most common AI model found is LLM (Large Language Model), takes Text as input and outputs Text\n",
    "    example -- OpenAI, LLama\n",
    "    - LLMs can create images using additional functionality called Tools\n",
    "    - Agent can perform any task via Tools to complete Actions\n",
    "    - Design of Tool has a great impact on the quality of Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "- the body (capabilities and tools) <-- it represents everything the Agent is equipped to do\n",
    "    - scope of possible actions -- what the agent has been equipped with\n",
    "    - example -- humans lack wings, they can't perform the \"fly\" Action, but can execute Actions like \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"grab\", and so on\n",

    "Agent uses AI model (typically an LLM) as its core reasoning engine to\n",
    "    - Understand natural language (interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way)\n",
    "    - Reason and plan (analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems)\n",
    "    - Interact with its environment (gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions)\n",
